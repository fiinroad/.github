# Welcome to FinRoad ðŸ‘‹
FinRoad is dedicated to simplifying financial planning for everyone. We believe that achieving financial independence shouldnâ€™t be complicated. Our goal is to make financial tools accessible and intuitive, empowering users to make informed decisions about investments, retirement, and major financial milestones, like buying a home.

## About FinRoad
FinRoad offers an all-in-one financial planning app, designed to help users:

- Plan and manage investments based on personal goals and risk levels.
- Prepare for retirement with realistic projections of income, savings, and expenses.
- Evaluate home affordability by understanding mortgage options, property costs, and affordability based on income.

Our app combines these features with a simple, user-friendly interface built in Flutter, allowing us to deliver a consistent experience across devices.

## Why **FinRoad**?
We started FinRoad because we saw a gap in the market for a financial planning tool thatâ€™s:

- Easy to use â€“ Financial tools shouldnâ€™t be intimidating. We focus on clear guidance and actionable insights.
- Comprehensive â€“ By covering investments, retirement, and home-buying in one app, we give users a full view of their financial journey.
- Accessible â€“ Built in Flutter, our app works seamlessly across platforms, providing the same intuitive experience for everyone.
